Code runs on windows
(but we still included a make file that should set everything up with a make command)

***WARNING***
would not run on local machine due to Eigen errors. 


RayTracer

Renders a scene using the ray tracing algorithm. Takes a text input file specifying a scene to be rendered.
Input files contain objects (spheres, triangles, or even obj files) and lights (point and directional).

We used the Blinn-Phone shading model in our project. 

Same sample input/output files are including in the 184 images folder.
